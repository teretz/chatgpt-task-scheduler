Milestone 1: Data Preparation

Task 1: Export Tasks Data

Identify and list the tasks to be exported from Azure Pipelines.
Extract task-related information (task name, description, status, etc.).
Store the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).
Task 2: Data Formatting

Define a clear format for organizing the extracted data.
Ensure each data entry includes relevant fields understandable by ChatGPT.
Milestone 2: Integration Setup

Task 3: Data Transfer to ChatGPT

Research OpenAI's provided integration methods (API, web interface).
Obtain necessary credentials or tokens for ChatGPT access.
Task 4: API Integration

Develop code to make HTTP requests to the ChatGPT API.
Include the formatted task data in the request payload.
Implement methods to handle API responses and extract model's suggestions.
Task 5: Custom Integration

Create a script (e.g., in Python) for interacting with ChatGPT.
Utilize libraries like requests for making API requests.
Design methods to parse API responses and extract actionable insights.
Task 6: ChatGPT Interface (Web Automation)

Research web automation tools like Selenium for automating web interactions.
Write a script to simulate user input in the ChatGPT web interface.
Develop methods to extract and process responses from the webpage.
Milestone 3: Response Processing

Task 7: Response Extraction

Implement logic to extract relevant suggestions or recommendations from ChatGPT responses.
Handle scenarios where model responses may need further processing.
Milestone 4: Action Implementation

Task 8: Displaying Suggestions

Design a user interface to display ChatGPT's suggestions.
Implement methods to present task-related recommendations to the user.
Task 9: Task Completion Automation

Based on ChatGPT's suggestions, design methods to automatically mark tasks as complete or update their statuses.
Milestone 5: Testing and Refinement

Task 10: Testing

Conduct thorough testing of the integration.
Verify data accuracy and the correctness of suggestions.
Task 11: Refinement

Analyze user feedback and model responses for improvements.
Refine methods to enhance the accuracy and usability of suggestions.
Milestone 6: Deployment and Maintenance

Task 12: Deployment

Deploy the integrated solution to a production environment.
Task 13: Maintenance

Set up regular monitoring to ensure the integration is functioning correctly.
Address any issues or errors that may arise over time.

Note: Azure integration has been skipped for now, but placeholders or disabled code are in place.
